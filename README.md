## What code monkey course is this for? ##
It is for the python chat bot!


## Credits ##
Me obviously and thats it!

## How it works ##
Just copy and paste from whatever text file you need. The number in the name of the text file
is related to what level the code is used on.

## Why? ##
* Because I am a very bored person rn
* Also because there is no help me button on all of these levels -_-
